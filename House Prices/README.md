# Kaggle house prices competition

In this section I have added my projects regarding the house prices competion, available at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). 

The code is written in R and it uses the XGboost model.

All the code is my own production and I made it available as reference.
