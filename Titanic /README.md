# Titanic competition

In this section I have added my projects regarding the very well knows Titanic competition, available at this [link](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 

The code is written in R and it uses the Random Forest model. The HTML files contains all informatio about how the modelling was done. 

All the code is my own production and I made it available as reference.
